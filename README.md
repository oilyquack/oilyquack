# OilyQuack ðŸ›¢ðŸ¦†

An overly engineered personal website for me to sell my wares and experiment with some new technologies/things that take my interest.

As a first go around, I wanted to see what the hype was about with Gatsby (spoilers: itâ€™s neat) and continue my new love with CSS modules.

## Dependencies ðŸ““

This project requires the following:

- The [Gatsby CLI Tool](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli)

To build, run the command `gatsby develop`.

## TODO

- Create blog
